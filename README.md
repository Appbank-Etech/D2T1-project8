**How to contribute to a project in your organization **
Steps to contribute to a project are as follows:
- git clone (repo Url) ------> To clone remote project repository into my local machine.
- git checkout -b feature ---> To create a new feature branch and switch into it.
- Then add the modification--> e.g. “vi contact.txt”, add a new contact number and address.
- git add . -----------------> to move files from working area to staging area.
- git commit -m ‘contact info added’ ----> to commit files into local repository. 
- git checkout main ---------> to switch into the main branch
- git push origin dev -------> to push the feature branch to the remote repository.
- Then go to the UI of the remote repository and create a pull request to compare main branch (base) with the dev 
  and assign it to a senior engineer to review the PR before merging to the main branch.
- Delete the feature branch after the merge to the main branch.
